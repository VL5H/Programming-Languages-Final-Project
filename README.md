# Programming-Languages-Final-Project
My final project for the programming languages class.

I created this baskeball simulator in python using the asyncio co-routines module for added effeciency.

The simulator can be played with a friend or against a computer for a total of 10 rounds (this limit can be easily modifed in the game.py file if one desires).
Each player has the option to shoot the ball (for 2 points or 3), pass the ball from one teammate to another, or check the current score/stats of each player on their team.

The match continues until there are no rounds left at which point a winner will be automatically determined.

Enjoy!
